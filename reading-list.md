## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This reading list is designed to get you up to speed on current work on misinfosec: the intersection between information security and misinformation.  It also includes references to help information security people understand misinformation mechanisms, and misinformation people understand information security frameworks and practice.  If you have references to add to the list and know where they belong, please add them there; otherwise, add them to the "references to sort through" list and we'll find them a home.

## Books <a name="books"></a>

### From Sara-Jayne's post:
 * Benkler, Faris, Roberts "[Network Propaganda: manipulation, disinformation, and radicalization in American politics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40846641-network-propaganda)". Example quote: "Something fundamental was happening to threaten democracy, and our collective eye fell on the novel and rapidly changing - technology." A data scientists' book, in that it looks at the systems in play, analyses the data available, and considers how insights from it could be applied in other situations. I've been recommending this to people who want to start building fixes.
 * Singer and Brooking "[LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38242140-likewar)". Example quote: "Narrative, emotion, authenticity, community, and inundation are the most effective tools of online battles". Clearly illustrates a lot of basic ideas in misinformation, written by people who've tracked its effects. Personally I find it over-hawkish: I know that we need to talk about information warfare, but one person's infowars is sometimes another person's politics, or advertising, or just plain interesting community or meme. I also found the pace slow, but that might be because I've lived through a lot of these things (some of the illustrations are events that I've worked myself). Could be a good introduction for someone completely new to the area.
 * Jamieson "[Cyberwar: how Russian hackers and trolls helped elect a president](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39507917-cyberwar)". Example quote: "Outcome three: the former Secretary of State is elected and the country simply moves on, but the sabotage nonetheless has magnified cultural tensions and functioned as a pilot from which to birth later success - perhaps when she runs for a second term". A scholarly work with a lot of insight specifically on the fragility of American politics; the style reminds me of a three-letter-agency report. Useful if you want to understand how America got to where it is now; could be well matched with Heuer's "[Structured Analytics Techniques for intelligence analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7818985-structured-analytic-techniques-for-intelligence-analysis)".
 * Watts "[Messing with the enemy: surviving in a social media world of hackers terrorists, Russians and fake news](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068856-messing-with-the-enemy)". Example quote: "Having trained at the FBI academy and studied Soviet politics, military and intelligence at West Point, I recognized the technique as the digital update to age-old spycraft". First-person account from one of the people I call "trackers" - individuals who interact with terrorist and misinformation accounts and targets online. Useful if you want to understand what tracking misinformation online looks like in practice.
 * Denning "[Information Warfare and Security](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/597681.Information_Warfare_and_Security)". Misinformation attacks are a form of hacking. If you really want to understand information warfare, and where the misinformation version of it might go next, Denning is the classic book. Read it.
 * Berger "[Contagious: why things catch on](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15801967-contagious)". If you want to understand misinformation, you need to understand belief systems, online belief transfer and specifically how we transfer beliefs through things like memes. This book helps.
 * Johnson "[The information diet: a case for conscious consumption](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12799077-the-information-diet)". A book focussed on the problem of online information overload, written at the time that crisis data teams first started seeing test misinformation messages appearing during disasters (Kate Starbird has detailed these in [her work](https://medium.com/hci-design-at-uw/tracing-disinformation-trajectories-from-the-2010-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-79e8116e08f4)), by the person who managed Obama's online campaign. I re-read this to remind myself of where we've come from online.
 * Tufekci "[Twitter and tear gas: the power and fragility of networked protest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32714239-twitter-and-tear-gas)". A tool is a tool. The things that are useful to someone running a misinformation campaign are also useful to someone supporting an honest political campaign, or a popular revolution. The author understands well both parts of this, and works through the Arab Spring, algorithms and surveillance states as part of this new internet power.
 * Brunton and Nissenbaum "[Obfuscation: a user's guide for privacy and protest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25796900-obfuscation)". Keeping yourself safe and private is hard work these days. This "how-to" book for individuals has lots of useful ideas that could be scaled and/or automated.
 * O'Neil "[Weapons of math destruction: how big data increases inequality and threatens democracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction)". Future campaigns will most likely be a combination of people and algorithms targetting people and algorithms. This book describes what happens when algorithms are applied to people's lives without care, e.g. without checking for bias or discrimination in the data or models that they're built with, but that lack of care could also be created through model poisoning and other algorithm-based attacks.
 * Saxe and Sanders "[Malware data science: attack detection and attribution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213382-malware-data-science)". Misinformation, botnets, campaigns, trolls: to date they've been fairly crude, mostly manual or only lightly automated. That's changing, and it's worth keeping up with trends in the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to hacking, to see what might be coming next. There aren't many books on this subject yet: here's a good one.
